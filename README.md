Thank [@eclipsegst](https://github.com/eclipsegst), originated from and motivated by whose critics, this repo is born. <br/>

Nowadays it is extremely hard to find someone who can criticize you. It is even harder to find someone who criticizes you on the very same issue more than once, which means he cares about you more than you do. <br/> 

One step at a time, worth million words. <br/>
The promise kept in this repo, as per week:
* either 6 interview Q&A, no matter how small they are
* or 100 lines of Android programming, no matter how lame they are

If this minimum cannot be achieved by any chance, I would rather never touch Android. The actions, and thus experiences, tell the difference between dreams and jokes. A dream without any execution merely is Deja Vu.
